# Student-Marking
This project uses VBA code in Microsoft Excel to access a database filled with student information and display it.

The user is prompted to select an option. They must first select a database to pull from. Then the user is brought back to the main screen where they can view student information in a sheet called 'Students' or they can display an average which will be shown in a sheet called 'Average'. 

When selecting view student information the user must select a course. All students first name, last name, and student ID is displayed. 

When viewing the average all marks for every assignment is shown. The mean, median, mode, max, min, and standard deviation are all shown for each assignment type. 

Next the user will generate a chart which shows a bar graph breakdown of every student enrolled in a course and their mark for a chosen assignment.

Finally the user can generate a report which creates a Microsoft Word document that summarizes all the findings from the user's actions.

Thank you for taking the time to read about my project.
